One of my favorite websites to dig around on is [https://filmsforaction.org](https://filmsforaction.org). It has a great collection of articles, short videos, and documentaries to choose from regarding a wide range of political topics from climate change to human rights abuses. I found out about this documentary while I was digging around on there for something to watch and the description intrigued me, so I decided to give it a shot. Once I started watching it, I realized it was made by Metanoia Films, the same company that made another documentary I love called _Plutocracy_, so I knew from there this would be fantastic. I wasn’t wrong, and this is one of the most informative documentaries I’ve seen in a while.

Counter-Intelligence is split into five parts, clocking in just under six and a half hours long altogether. The first four parts are my favorite, covering the development of the CIA, along with their vast network of NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) they use to wash and distribute funds and multiple different operations they’ve been involved in. Two of the most interesting covert operations they touch on in these parts that I hadn’t known about yet are: 1) The CIA’s involvement in conspiring against former Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam (it’s pretty surprising, but not completely unexpected, that they’d conspire against an allied nation), and 2) Operation Gladio, which has been linked to multiple massacres and assassinations in Europe. Part five touches on Obama’s drone program and the inherent injustice of the 2012 NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act), which authorizes the US armed forces to indefinitely detain anyone at anytime, anywhere, without due process. I learned a lot from it and it’s a pretty long documentary overall, but it’s well worth a watch.
