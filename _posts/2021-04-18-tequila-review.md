It still trips me out that Hip Hop — a trend started by some teenage gangbangers in the South Bronx — became the most listened to music genre in America last decade, managing to touch every continent on the planet.

There’s a Youtube channel called COLORS which has different singers and rappers from around the world come on and perform with one solid color in the background — presumably so you just focus on the music. The idea’s genius already, but every artist they bring on is amazing, too. I watch a lot of them, but I actually came across this song after I saw this girl I follow on Snapchat dancing to it on her story. I used Shazam to find out what it was called (I refuse to give her the chance to say “I put you onto her!”) and I coudn’t stop playing it for a day straight. She speaks Portuguese, but I don’t need to understand it to know it’s a banger.
